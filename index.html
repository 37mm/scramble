        <p>Scramble includes a user-friendly webmail interface. You can check your email from anywhere, even a library computer. Scramble also can exchange email with regular, insecure email addresses. This is obviously not as secure as communication between two Scramble servers, but it allows you to use Scramble as your email provider right away.</p>

        <p>Scramble is an open-source protocol. Scramble.io makes it easy to get started, but for complete control, host your own Scramble server. This is an especially attractive option for enterprises and non-profit organizations that need to keep proprietary IP and communications safe from prying eyes. Unlike some other “secure” email services, our source is and will always be completely open and auditable.</p>

      <h3>Zero knowledge</h3>

      <p>Most existing email systems only encrypt data during transmission, but get stored as plaintext on the mail-server. Other email systems like Lavabit also encrypt the email before storage, but are encrypted on the server and are vulnerable to government fiat or server-compromise. Scramble servers have zero-knowledge of the message contents, since encryption is always performed end-to-end on the clients.</p>

      <p>When a user first registers on a Scramble server, an OpenPGP keypair is generated on the client. The public key is used by senders for encrypting messages for the key owner, and the private key is used for signing (authenticating) messages from the key owner. The user does not need to worry about managing their keys, because they are stored on the server.</p>

      <p>The users’ private keys are stored on the server in encrypted form. The key-derivation-function used is as follows:
      <pre>K = scrypt(Passphrase, Nonce || Username)</pre>
      where <code>Passphrase</code> is the user’s secret login passphrase, <code>Nonce</code> is a predetermined string, and <code>||</code> is the concatenation operator.</p>

      <p>Keypair generation and ephemeral symmetric key generation depends on using the browser’s crypto.getRandomValues() cryptographic pseudo-random-number-generator function. The standard Javascript random() function is not cryptographically secure, but modern browsers now support the crypto API.</p>

      <h3>No exchanging keys</h3>

      <p>A Scramble address is associated with a public key. In order to encrypt a message for a recipient (and in order to verify the authenticity of a message), the sender needs to resolve the Scramble address of the recipient and retrieve the public key.</p>
        
      <p>The established way to do this with PGP today is with the web-of-trust (WOT) model. Identities are endorsed by other identities via cryptographic signatures. It is encouraged to do this in person (e.g. at key signing parties) where you can see the person and her public key together. The problem with this approach is that the web is cumbersome to build up, and few people actually participate in such key-signing parties.</p>
        
      <p>Scramble uses an alternative federated trust model inspired by the Perspectives project. Assume there are many Scramble servers, just as there are many email-servers today. Each Scramble server provides a notary service that vouches for Scramble identities. Upon account creation on one Scramble server, all the notaries are seeded with the new identity. Later, anyone can fetch and verify the public key for this new address by querying all or some of the seeded notaries. Since the notary responses are cryptographically signed, an attacker would have to compromise all of the notaries in order to subvert the address-resolution process.</p>

      <h3>Secure client-side code</h3>

      <p>Scramble aims to provide strong security guarantees without compromising on usability. Webmail is the easiest way to reach a wide audience, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Once you have a trusted client, our design doesn't require you to trust the server. However, the server cannot be trusted to serve uncompromised client-side code. To solve this problem, we are going to develop a browser extension that checks the integrity of the client code.</p>

      <p>This is still a work in progress. For now you must assume that the server is uncompromised. Do not use Scramble.io for sensitive information just yet! </p>
